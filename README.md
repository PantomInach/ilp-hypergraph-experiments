# Experiments on Hypergraphs VS Graphs
This repository provides an example of a comparison between the efficiency of hypergraph based models compared to graph based models for rolling stock scheduling.
The simplified model is based on the model in the paper ["Comparison of hypergraph vs graph modelling of a rolling stock scheduling problem"](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/inte.2020.1069).

## Running the Models
First install this module with `pip install .` after cloning the repository. Then to run both models, execute `python3 -m ilp-hypergraph-experiments`. To only run the benchmark, execute `python3 -m ilp-hypergraph-experiments --bench`.

# Information
This project is part of the practical work of the seminar 'Optimierung im Passagiertransport / Optimization in Passenger Transport' in the winter term 23/24 from the university of [WÃ¼rzburg](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/).
