# Experiments on Hypergraphs VS Graphs
This repository provides an example of a comparison between the efficiency of hypergraph based models compared to graph based models for rolling stock scheduling.
The simplified model is based on the model in the paper ["Comparision of hypergraph vs graph modelling of a rolling stock scheduling problem"](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/inte.2020.1069).

## Assumptions
- Each edge can only be used for one trip
